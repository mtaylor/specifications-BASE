= Computing Context

NOTE: This section is informative only, and intended as a guide to possible implementation.

Expressions may contain user-defined functions and procedures, whose signatures are declared in the `definition` part of an EL text. The implementations of such routines can be developed or provided in a library in any language, e.g. TypeScript, Java, C#, Python etc. Implementations of used routines are bound to their EL declarations in the `computing_context` section of a full EL text. The following provides an example in which two libraries, one in Java and one in Python are bound to functions declared in an EL text.

--------

In the above, the Java function `_tnmNumericVal()_` from the class `TnmCalculator` is bound to the EL-declared function `_tnm_major_number()_`. It is assumed that the two functions match in signatures, i.e. have the same number of arguments in the same order and of the same types. This is most likely to be achieved by writing a wrapper class around one or more classes that are found in existing libraries. Additionally, it must be possible for the implementation class to be instantiated with no arguments.

TBD: or else they have to be supplied in the binding
